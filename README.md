![Periodictable Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/periodictable/main/logo.png)

The Python's Periodictable Package is a powerful and comprehensive Python library for working with the periodic table of elements. It provides easy access to a wealth of information about the chemical elements, making it an essential tool for scientists, educators, and anyone interested in chemistry.

## Features

- **Element Information**: Access detailed information about each element, including atomic number, symbol, name, atomic weight, electron configuration, and more.

- **Isotopes**: Retrieve information about isotopes of each element, such as mass, abundance, and half-life.

- **Chemical Properties**: Get various chemical properties for each element, including electronegativity, atomic radius, and more.

- **Interactive Periodic Table**: Visualize the periodic table with a built-in interactive interface to explore element properties easily.

- **Chemical Equations**: Calculate molar masses and balance chemical equations with ease.

- **Chemical Conversions**: Perform unit conversions for various chemical quantities.

- **Element Search**: Find elements by their name, symbol, or atomic number quickly.

## Installation

You can install Python's Periodictable Package using pip:

```bash
pip install periodictable
```

## Usage

Here's a quick example of how to use the package:

```python
import periodictable

# Get information about an element
element = periodictable.elements.symbol('H')
print(element.name, element.number, element.mass)
```
